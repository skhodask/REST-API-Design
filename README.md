# REST-API-Design
A self-learning project where I explore professional-grade REST APIs and the design process behind them through the guidance of an expert. 
The goal of this project is for me to understand the different layers of a web server and how web applications interact with each other.

### My Process
- Built a secure and reliable REST API that includes authentication, logging, caching, and more.
- Implemented advanced features like token refresh
- Handled log-outs and prevented abuse with Json Web Token (JWT) blacklisting
- Utilized object-oriented design to avoid redundant code
- Stored resources within a SQL database
- Deployed the application to Heroku + explored application deployment to AWS
- Set up Cloudflare
### Advanced Features
- Implemented advanced functionality in the API such as image upload, payments, and user confirmation emails
- Utilized Marshmallow for Serialization
- Deployed documentation pages and tested my API witth Postman's collection runner
- Improved operations of existing REST APIs with database migrations and refactoring knowledge
- Explored third party login with OAuth
