# REST-API-Design
A self-learning project where I explore professional-grade REST APIs and the design process behind them through the guidance of an expert. The goal of this project is for me to understand the different layers of a web server and how web applications interact with each other.

### My Process
built a secure and reliable REST API that includes authentication, logging, caching, and more.
implemented advanced features like token refresh
handled log-outs and prevented abuse with Json Web Token (JWT) blacklisting
utilized object-oriented design to avoid redundant code
stored resources within a SQL database
deployed the application to Heroku + explored application deployment to AWS
set up Cloudflare
Advanced Features
implemented advanced functionality in the API such as image upload, payments, and user confirmation emails
Utilized Marshmallow for Serialization
deployed documentation pages and tested my API witth Postman's collection runner
improved operations of existing REST APIs with database migrations and refactoring knowledge
Explored third party login with OAuth
